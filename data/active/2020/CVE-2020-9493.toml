# The log4j:apache-chainsaw artifact is not technically distributed on maven central; therefore, GitHub will
# not currently accept this update per https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2630/; however, 
# chainsaw was packaged into early distributions of log4j and is identifiable by this distinct maven identifier 
# so treat it as a distinct component.
